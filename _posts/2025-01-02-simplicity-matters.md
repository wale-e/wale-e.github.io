# Simplicity Matters

When onboarding new developers to a framework, simplicity should be the priority. Their initial experience—getting from "0 to 1"—must be as minimal and straightforward as possible. This means avoiding unnecessary dependencies and concepts that add complexity.

This principle is especially relevant for AI agent frameworks. The starting point for developers should exclude any built-in social integrations (like Twitter/X, Discord, Telegram, or Farcaster). Adding these layers creates unnecessary overhead and distractions for someone just starting.

Let’s focus on first principles: **How minimal can an AI agent framework be?** Running an LLM should be the baseline. That’s it.

I strongly urge framework maintainers to consider making [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) the default LLM option or supporting it natively. Not every developer can afford the fees associated with OpenAI or Anthropic APIs, and frameworks that emphasize open-source and free options make the field more accessible. Encouraging experimentation by reducing barriers to entry is critical to bringing more developers into this exciting space.

As a polyglot programmer, my mission is to help onboard as many developers as possible into the AI agent domain. To support this, I plan to create written posts for all three frameworks—[**Eliza**](https://elizaos.ai/), [**Rig**](https://rig.rs/), and [**Zerepy**](https://github.com/blorm-network/ZerePy)—to share knowledge and lower the learning curve.

This is an opinionated post, but I hope I’ve made a compelling case for simplicity, accessibility, and open experimentation in AI agent frameworks.

Thank you!
